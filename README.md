# Custom Transposition Cipher with Hash-based Integrity Check
This project implements a Transposition Cipher for encryption and decryption of alphabetic plaintext using a custom hash-based integrity verification. The hash ensures the correctness of the decrypted text, and a brute-force attack is supported to demonstrate key discovery via property checking.

üîê Features
Custom Hash Generator: Generates an 8-character hash using character-wise XOR and left-shifting logic.

Transposition Cipher:

Encryption with columnar transposition.

Decryption using the inverse key.

Integrity Check: Ensures decryption validity using a computed hash check.

Brute-Force Attack: Tries all possible key permutations up to a given length and checks for valid plaintext.



üîì Decryption + Check
Decrypt using the same key.

Use propertyCheck() to verify integrity via the hash.


üí• Brute Force
Try permutations of keys from length 1 to key_length.

Decrypt each with Decryptor.

Pass each output to propertyCheck.
